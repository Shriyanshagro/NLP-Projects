Challenges -

1. Wheather to use '@' as separater, as it could be used to identify Nouns, So I haven't use it as separater.

2. How to keep intact URLs, without get it separated through ':',"/",'.', so for this I have used a regex, in each of these separators.

3. In some cases urls are incomplete and ended with multi-dots("...."), so to remove multi-dots I have again used regex '\.* ', to keep intact Urls as much as possible.

4. Emotions are used at many places with different special characters, such as ":-)" and \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f,
 so I removed ':-)' kind of characters as they are not special signs(:-)) while kept other kind as they are special signs(❤️).

5. I have removed all punctuations, excluding apostrophe as it also tokenized words like "I'm" or "don't".

6. Wheather to use '#' as separater, as it could be used to signify type of label or metadata tag used on social network and microblogging services
    which makes it easier for users to find messages with a specific theme or content, So I haven't use it as separater.

7. As while tokenising, the last word of sentences contain '\n', so I have removed this from words.
